# HUON
JSON variant (HUman Object Notation)

This repository contains PHP and JavaScript implementations of HUON, a human-readable yet efficient structured data language. Also contained are PHP and JavaScript testing programs, with about 100 identical tests.

Bug reports are requested. Requests and suggestions will be noted, but are unlikely to be adopted in order to keep this data language and tools simple. Primary development and bug fixes are done outside of GitHub by the developer.
